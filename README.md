Nigozi Engine is a game engine framework designed to make 2D devolopment easier in C++. The engine is in the beginning stages of devlopment, many features and systems are yet to come!

***

## Platform
The engine primarly supports Windows.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2020 (and above) is recommended, but you are free to try other applications to build the project.

<ins>**1. Downloading the repository:**</ins>

Start cloning the repository with ```git clone --recursive https://github.com/LukaLominadze/NigoziEngine```

<ins>**2. Building the project:**</ins>

After cloning the repository, simply run the ```Setup-windows.bat``` file.

The project now is ready.

# Dependencies
- GLFW - For window creation and event polling
- GLEW - For importing OpenGL functions
- GLM - For math
- StbImage - For handling/loading images
- DearImGui - For UI, very useful in realtime applications

# The plan
The plan for Nigozi Engine is to make a 2D framework that makes the development process simple and clear and to provide core functionality and features many games have.

# Short-term goals
- Add ECS
- Add new shaders

# Long-term goals
- Create an Editor to make game creation easier
- Add a scripting language
- Implement audio systems
